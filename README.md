# Computer Graphics Assignment 1
 
How was the item implemented (what was modified and done differently from the class and labs to fit the context of your scene?), how does your scene benefit from the way the item was implemented?

Toon Rim Shader/Metalic Rim Shader - Modified by taking the toon shader/metalic shader and rim light shader and combining the two to make a new shader. It benefits my scene by having a new and creative asset to show off towards the end of the museum.

The explanation must be supported with diagrams for the code that was implemented, screenshots, and videos/animated gifs.
